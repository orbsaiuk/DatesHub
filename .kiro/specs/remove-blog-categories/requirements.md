# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves removing the category system from the blog functionality. Currently, blogs have a required category field that references a separate category document type. This change will eliminate the category dependency from blogs, simplify the blog data structure, and remove category-related UI components and queries.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want blogs to no longer require categories, so that I can create and manage blog posts without the overhead of category management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new blog post THEN the system SHALL NOT require a category selection
2. WHEN editing an existing blog post THEN the system SHALL NOT display category selection options
3. WHEN viewing the blog schema in Sanity Studio THEN the category field SHALL NOT be present
4. WHEN saving a blog post THEN the system SHALL successfully save without any category reference

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a blog reader, I want to view blog posts without category information, so that I can focus on the content without category-based navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a blog card THEN the system SHALL NOT display category badges or labels
2. WHEN viewing a blog detail page THEN the system SHALL NOT show category information
3. WHEN browsing blogs THEN the system SHALL NOT provide category-based filtering options
4. WHEN viewing related blogs THEN the system SHALL use alternative methods for determining relevance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all category-related code removed from the blog system, so that the codebase is clean and maintainable without unused category references.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying blogs THEN the system SHALL NOT include category projections in GROQ queries
2. WHEN the blog schema is processed THEN the system SHALL NOT reference the category field
3. WHEN blog components render THEN the system SHALL NOT attempt to access category data
4. WHEN building related blog queries THEN the system SHALL use alternative criteria instead of category matching

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want existing blog data to remain intact after category removal, so that no blog content is lost during the migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the category field is removed from the schema THEN existing blog posts SHALL remain accessible
2. WHEN querying existing blogs THEN the system SHALL handle missing category references gracefully
3. WHEN displaying existing blogs THEN the system SHALL render properly without category data
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all blog functionality SHALL work without category dependencies

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the blog creation and editing process to be simplified, so that I can focus on writing content without managing categories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the blog creation form THEN the system SHALL NOT include category selection fields
2. WHEN the blog creation process completes THEN the system SHALL save successfully without category validation
3. WHEN editing existing blogs THEN the system SHALL not show or require category information
4. WHEN validating blog data THEN the system SHALL NOT enforce category requirements
